Bug:

Infinite loop because of an inifinite loop

infinte loop mean that there are no more token to consume

maybe the uop value is kept across the loop

problem is more general than loop

print "int:" + str(self.input.tokenType()) if token type is const

while(op in list_op) op is not modified by operation in loop --> infinite loop

Problem:

Why function are not compiled? (maybe it is not reached yet)

How to handle error in the code?
